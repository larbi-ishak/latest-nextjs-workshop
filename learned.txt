_prd      folders begins with underscore won't be included in routing

layout.tsx , layouts are nested by default
layout are server side components
layout can fetch data

only RootLayout can access html and body tags

you can change routes programmatically using Links, redirect method or useRouter hook
links is the go to and useRouter is the least advised

you can use prefetching with Link element or router.prefetch()
prefetching works only in production

next js uses caching, partial rendering nad soft navigation ( by defalt browser makes a hard reload, but with next js no full page reload, app state is preserved only segements re rendering)


export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const {pages} =  require("../../../data/links.json")
  
  return pages.map((post: any) => ({
    id: post.title,
  }))
}
 export const dynamicParams = false //fallback previously

@somethng used for parallel routing
